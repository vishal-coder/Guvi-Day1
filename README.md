## [Scripting Language vs Programming(compiled) Language](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17253545/scripting-language-vs-programming-language) 
  1. Scripting languages are programming languages that don't require an explicit compilation step.  
      + C vs javascript (JS Doesn't required explicit compilation step)  
      + During compilation of programming language compiler takes complete source file and converts it into machine code - 
          *  no need to share source code
          *  Fast as already compiled  
      + During interpretation of Scripting language single line of code is converted into machine code 
        - need to share source code
        - slow execution speed as conversion happens on the go
  2. Programming Language : Is compiled to machine code and run on the hardware of the underlying Operating System i.e. it targets computing system.
  3. Scripting Language : Is unstructure subset of programming language. It is generally interpreted and it  targets a software system  
  4. If we say that the real difference is whether it is compiled or not, then we have a problem because when Javascript runs in V8 is compiled and when it runs in Rhino is not.
